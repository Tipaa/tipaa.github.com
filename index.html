<h2>Edmund Smith's Github Pages</h2>
<div class="main">
<p>This is a collection of not many projects that I have mde in the lst month or two. I didn't know how to use git before then, so this only represents a small (and not very finished) representation of my work.</p>
<p>I'd like this to become a kind of portfolio piece or page, but I'm not sure how or what I'd put in a portfolio. I'm only 16, so I haven't had a big name job where I can say 'I did that'. However, I am looking for work.</p>
</div>
<div class="tall">
<p>Once I have more to show off, I'll probably add them to this little sidebar here. Until then, I have little on display.</p>
<p>I might make a CSS 3D gallery of work somewhere, and add images. This page is currently experimental though.</p>
<p>I'd like to make more CSS layouts like this. That would be interesting.</p>
