<h2>Visual DASM .NET - An Integrated Development Environment for the DCPU-16 specification</h2>
<div class="main">
<p>Visual DASM .NET is a suite of tools designed for developing programs for the DCPU-16. It has all that a conventional IDE would be expected to contain - syntax and error highlighting, an assembler, a debugger/emulator and a disassembler.</p>
<p>It is under active development, and is constantly evolving. Written in C#, it should be portable to both Windows with .NET and Linux under Mono.</p><test><?php phpinfo(); ?></test>

<p>You can click <a href="https://github.com/Tipaa/DCPU-ASM-IDE">here</a> to go to my Github Repository to download the sources.</p>
<p>I don't yet have a proper license for the code, so for now everything you do with it is at your own risk and may be used in anything non-commerical with attribution.</p>
<p>I don't like draconian licenses - copyright or copyleft. I try to avoid both.</p>
